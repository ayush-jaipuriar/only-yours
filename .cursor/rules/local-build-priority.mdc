# Local Build Priority

- For Android/iOS development, default to local builds on the developer machine.
- Use cloud builds only when explicitly requested or when local signing/tooling constraints block progress.
- Prefer `expo run:android` / local dev-client workflows for iteration speed.
- Before suggesting cloud builds, first check and configure local prerequisites (Node, Java, Android SDK, adb, Expo tooling).
- Keep fallback cloud instructions available, but treat them as secondary.
